thinking out loud

Layered architecture when it comes to simulate a User

things that impact a users POV ?
- Physical (AGE, WEIGHT, SEX, physical ailments)
- Mental (
    current mood, 
    their values (conscious principles), 
    their biases (unconscious patterns),
    their likes and dislikes, 
    Experiential eg: how much they know about a field
)

User Context:

This is the context that is requiered at bare minimum when it comes to talking to BOT

Eg: 
when talking to a `Road Trip planner BOT`
- Does the user have an electric of gas car.

when talking to a `Health Insurance BOT`
- what is the users plan and coverage
- who are the dependents in the plan 
etc

So this layer is very context dependent on the type of BOT someone needs to interact with .


Explicit preference :

user explicitly calling out their preferences
