what are the fundamentals of a conversation

Understanding the goal of the conversation 
Can be categorized as 
Query: User looking to read information about the what , why , how and when about something
Action: User asking the assistant to perform some action on its behalf
Vibe : No clear intent , User is just putting their thoughts down . This can still be usefult to identify users preferences, get feedback and understand what they value. (how does this tie back to udating the users profile created by User Simulation)
